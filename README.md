# Wordsearch
Let's make a word search! The project will use Python to develop the most optimal solution for the presented objective.

## Objective
Search a randomly generated board of letters for words _as fast as possible_. Valid search directions include horizontal, vertical, diagonal (left to right), diagonal (right to left) and the reverse for each direction.

## Dictionary
The list of available words to search for can be found in `words.txt`.

## Performance Testing
A GitHub Workflow should be created that will execute the application. The total execution time should be displayed in the output, as well as any other relevant statistics such as memory used. 

### Target board
All performance tests should be run against a 15x15 board.
